## Overview
A small application in python which supports browsing leet code problems based on tags as well as allows multiple users to add their solutions.
This is an early prototype which can be extended to build a more sophisticated tool for sharing solutions to interview problems in a small group via a github repo.
The tagging scheme is simple and allows strings

Some tags for problems already solved in this repo : '2d_arrays', 'arithmetic', 'arrays', 'backtracking', 'bfs', 'binary', 'binary_search', 'binary_search_tree', 'binary_tree', 'bisect', 'bit_operations', 'dfs', 'dictionary', 'dp', 'graphs', 'greedy', 'heap', 'recursion', 'sliding_window', 'stack', 'strings', 'topological_sort', 'two_pointer_scan'

## How to run

cd app/py3
python3 main.py

The load up localhost:8888

To find all binary search related problems one can directly navigate to:
http://localhost:8888/tag/binary_search

The links are also available from the homepage.
